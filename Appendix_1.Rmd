Key Definitions Used (Gelman et al)

Sensitivity Analysis: how much do posterior inferences change when other reasonable probability models are used in place of the present model? Things that can change in the model to change the sensitivity:
    * Prior Specification
    * Sampling Distribution
    * Predictor Variables
    
External Validation: using the model to make predictions about future data, and then collecting those data and comparing to their predictions.
