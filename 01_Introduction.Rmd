# Introduction

There will be more than 700 000 homes created in the greater Sydney Region between now and 2036 as part of the Greater [Sydney Commission's Strategic Plan](https://www.greater.sydney/metropolis-of-three-cities/liveability/housing-city/greater-housing-supply). The effects this will have on property prices is as yet unknown but must be measured carefully in an effort to preserve, or improve, the lending ratio's in a highly leveraged market place. The factors that affect property prices are many and varied, access to services and business districts is considered a principle aspect among these.
