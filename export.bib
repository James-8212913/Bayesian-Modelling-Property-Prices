	abstract={It was suggested that while moods clearly are subject to tremendous variation, there may nonetheless be some utility in considering long-term differences in mood, that is, in treating mood as a personality characteristic. People who are characteristically at different points of a mood dimension may show real differences in behavior that are not totally obscured by short-term mood variation. This approach may also facilitate the investigation of components of mood other than level, which is the focus of most state mood questionnaires. A personality instrument for happy and sad moods, the Mood Survey, was factor-analyzed and found to have two primary subscales: Level and Reactivity. These intercorrelated subscales were shown to have consistent advantages over a state measure of mood both in predicting personality characteristics and in pointing to new hypotheses about the nature of mood.},

	abstract={Big data analytics associated with database searching, mining, and analysis can be seen as an innovative IT capability that can improve firm performance. Even though some leading companies are actively adopting big data analytics to strengthen market competition and to open up new business opportunities, many firms are still in the early stage of the adoption curve due to lack of understanding of and experience with big data. Hence, it is interesting and timely to understand issues relevant to big data adoption. In this study, a research model is proposed to explain the acquisition intention of big data analytics mainly from the theoretical perspectives of data quality management and data usage experience. Our empirical investigation reveals that a firm's intention for big data analytics can be positively affected by its competence in maintaining the quality of corporate data. Moreover, a firm's favorable experience (i.e., benefit perceptions) in utilizing external source data could encourage...},

	abstract={Keywords Non-directional social comparison; Facebook usage; Depressive symptoms; Mental health; Social media platforms Highlights * This study hypothesizes that one of the mediating factors could be the social comparisons that Facebook users conduct whilst on the site. * This paper therefore explores the link between non-directional social comparisons on Facebook, with increased depressive symptoms in 20 to 29 year olds. * The study found an inverse relationship between active Facebook use and non-directional social comparisons. * A positive correlation was found between passive Facebook use and non-directional social comparisons. Abstract The present paper explores the relationship between nature of Facebook usage, non-directional comparisons and depressive syndromes. The extant research on linkage between social media usage and mental health is inconclusive. The paper uses data collected through an online survey of 399 Facebook users in the UK. A Facebook frequency rating scale was developed and validated as a part of the study. The Iowa-Netherlands Comparison Orientation Measure was modified and used to measure social comparison. The depressive syndromes were captured by the modified Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The Rank Theory of Depression was used a guiding framework. The data collection had focused on the 20--29 year olds, as justified by the literature. The study found a negative relationship between active Facebook use and non-directional social comparisons. The relationship was reversed in the case of passive usage. There is small but significant causal linkage between increased non-directional social comparisons and depressive symptoms among the users.

	abstract={Introduction: As part of a large digital medicine study investigating the identification of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) using a continuous single-lead ECG patch, we evaluated the usability and the efficacy of a wrist wearable device for the detection of AF.Hypothesis: A wearable, non-ECG sensor will allow for rhythm monitoring for longer periods of time and therefore potentially provide the evidence to motivate future large studies on photoplethysmography (PPG) based AF detection.Methods: We provided via mail an Amiigo wrist worn PPG device (Wavelet Health) to 237 subjects randomly selected, along with instructions on how to use device and mobile app. Due to battery constraints, the devices collected PPG data for 30 seconds every 20 minutes during day and every 7 minutes by night. On a subset of the available data, the intervals of heart rate data were further analyzed by computing the Shannon entropy on the differences between consecutive RR intervals, and detecting AF event with a threshold based algorithm.Results: More than 6000 hours of PPG data were collected from participants during this digital health study. 137 patients wore their wristband at least 1 day. Average device usage was 99 (min=1, max=459) days per person, and a wear time of 10.7 (min=1, max=17) hours per day. The average worn duration was 8.4 hours at night. Part of the data cannot be analyzed due to motion artifacts, as expected for a PPG device. We considered 3 subject (2 of them with at least 1 AF event), and 2950 selected intervals of 30 seconds, of which 1475 with an AF event detected by the ECG based Xio Patch (iRhythm Tech. Inc.), which represents the ground truth in this study. Preliminary results show accuracy of 91% (2674/2950), specificity of 96%, and sensitivity of 85% in the detection of an AF event in a 30 second interval using a wearable PPG device.Conclusions: This first of its kind study shows feasibility of wearables data collection through self-enrollment of participants. We highlighted some issues due to the high variability in the device usage and the characteristics of the sensor limiting the amount of useful data for the analysis. Preliminary results indeed show high promise for future studies on the detection of AF events with wearable PPG devices.},

MCS aims to outsource sensing data collection to Mobile Device Owner (MDO) and it could revolutionize the conventional ways of sensing data collection and processing. Nonetheless, the widespread deployment of MCS gives rise to the privacy concerns from both the MDOs and the Sensing Service Consumers (SSC), especially in the case where MCS relies on untrustworthy third-party infrastructures. This paper proposes three protocols to address the privacy issues of MCS in ad hoc network without depending on any third-parties.

This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

Some of the key contributions of these studies to current scientific understanding include the identification of underlying topics within content (posts and messages), determination of each user’s influence and contributions, c) measurement of content quality, and extraction and analysis of users’ motives and preferences. We aimed to develop an integrative solution entailing a combination of these methodological advances within a single framework that could facilitate attribution and differentiate OSN members. Specifically, we examined peer effects within Twitter and assessed the propensity of members to alter their views on commonly discussed matters based on their exposure to alternative views expressed by respected and influential members. We availed of abundant available resources and tracked historical interactions of selected users to create a workable model that captured differences in opinions. The resulting solution enables peer influence within the online environment to be quantified and the level of investment of identified social media users in particular topics to be assessed.},

	abstract = 	 {Summary Corporate culture is far more than a loose collection of cultural artifacts. It unites the cornerstones of corporate mission, organizational structures, and personal conduct. Culture encompasses every aspect of how things work in an organization. Similar to the iceberg model, organizational culture has three levels: artifacts, espoused values, and basic assumptions. While the first two levels are visible and audible, the basic assumptions remain mostly unspoken and often unconscious too. The deciding factor for the success of change projects is whether these cultural routes are functional or not, whether they help process the desired change productively, or do they rather block the change? Many improvement initiatives fail because the power of corporate culture is not acknowledged at all, or at least not acknowledged enough. Ignoring micropolitical behavior and the dysfunctionality of power games in change processes contributes to this problem.},

	abstract={This case study explored the critical role a human resources department plays in developing and communicating an effective succession plan, specifically the criteria chosen to fill future vacancies in the organization. Businesses promote two parts of a succession plan: a plan to select the right people and a process to retain, promote, and train the appropriate people to fill a new position (Galagan, 2010). The emergent five themes were established from the data gathered from participant interviews and the assessment of internal documents from the human resources department. The findings strongly indicate discrepancies within succession planning criteria and a lack of a formal succession plan. Human resources directors are responsible for the success of the development, implementation, and communication of the organization's succession plan to support employee retention, engagement, and long-term growth for the organization.},

	abstract={"High-value talent management must be relevant to today's workplace Misplaced Talent takes a hard look at the cluttered field of Talent Management, and offers a clear guide to making better people decisions in any organization. Deliberately challenging practitioners to do more, this insightful discussion sorts through the tools and techniques developed over the last century to examine their true relevance to the modern workplace. You'll learn which activities show the greatest potential to improve the lives of employees and the organizations they work for, and identify which of your existing practices don't really add enough value to be worth the expenditure of time, money, and potentially lost talent. The author asks you to make up your own mind about which approaches work best for your own specific talent decisions, but provides the best theory and practice available today as a foundation upon which to formulate a more relevant strategy. In a world of big data, the potential to understand employees and react appropriately has never been greater. So why is Talent Management as an industry relying on outdated theory and practices? This book is a guide to bringing HR up to date, giving you the tools, techniques, and perspective you need to demonstrate more value to your organization. Adopt the tools and techniques most effective in today's workplace Identify and discard methods that don't add value to the organization Implement critical changes that can transform the HR function Make better people decisions based on psychology and research Fundamentally, not much has changed in what constitutes good people practice. Practitioners must demonstrate the value of Talent Management, but the solutions implemented often fall short of the rigor and discipline they deserve. Misplaced Talent provides the insight you need to refocus attention and engage your organization about the value of better people decisions"-- Provided by publisher.},

These results are compared with an extensive literature review.Findings - The survey results show that there is a gap between the perceived importance of various principles of succession planning and how well the principles are practiced. In addition, the age demographics of library leaders clearly show a need to prepare future leaders.Practical implications - From this research it was found that many libraries are not prepared to fill the vacancies of library leadership positions.Originality value - This original research provides data that may be lacking within the field in regards to the need for succession planning.},

	abstract={Research Summary: This paper analyzes how pay inequality influences divestiture decisions. Using detailed data on division manager compensation and divestiture activity, this study documents that firms are more likely to divest divisions when pay inequality among division managers is higher. To address potential bias in the measurement of pay inequality, we construct a “synthetic” measure that varies with regional and industry pay shocks that differentially affect division managers within firms. Post hoc analyses reveal that social comparison appears to explain, at least partially, the relationship between unequal pay and divestiture. These findings support the notion that pay inequality can be an important predictor of firm boundaries. More generally, they suggest that unequal pay may have significant strategic consequences as firms increasingly adopt performance‐based compensation to motivate employees.
